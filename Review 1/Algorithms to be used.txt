Algorithms: Random Forest, ARIMA, GARCH, SARIMAX

1. Random Forest to predict stock prices or investment trends by analyzing various features like historical prices, trading volumes. It combines 
many decision trees to make predictions.Itâ€™s good at handling large datasets.Ensemble learning

2. ARIMA is a statistical model used for forecasting time series data.ARIMA to predict future stock prices based on past price data.

3. GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model used to estimate the volatility of a time series. 
It helps in understanding how the variance (risk) of a stock price changes over time.
Implement GARCH to model and predict the volatility of stocks. This can help in assessing risks.

3. SARIMAX is an extension of ARIMA that includes seasonal effects and allows for external factors (regressors) to be considered.
Forecast stock prices or financial metrics that have seasonal patterns
